# About the project
This is a very basic client server system I created for learning reasons. The client can send a String to the server and the server will add the input to a .txt file and responds if the operation was successfull. The Client can also send "GET" in which the server will respond with the whole content of the file.

# server
server is running as C code using the socket library

# client
client is running as a kotlin app for android (and also C for desktop)
